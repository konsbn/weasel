# Methinks 'tis a weasel
This program was influenced by the [Dawkins Weasel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weasel_program) program that I saw in an old BBC documentary and it illustrated the rudiments of natural selection via genetic programming. This is my humble attempt to recreate that same code. You can even think of it as an Genetically Guided [Infinite Monkey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinite_monkey_theorem). The code is poorly documented but I hope it is amateurish enough to be understood by almost anyone. 
## Usage 
Just do
```
  python weasel.py
  ```
## Watch it in action
